*This is a personal project and has nothing to do with Fishbowl. They did not hire me, or asked me to do it.*

Fishbowl released their official app few weeks ago. I personally felt the home screen emphasized too much on the advertisement that it shadowed the functionality. 
That is why I wanted to redesign the app's home screen for myself.
